# MyMorseCodeApp

For the Applied IT Project, I designed a functioning Morse Code app. The app works as a Morse Code 
Translator. The user can enter text and have it translated to Morse Code or enter Morse Code and 
have it translated to text. The app's Morse Code reference chart allows the user to view the Morse
Code translations of letters, numbers, and punctuation. Using the app's quizzes, the user can 
improve their Morse Code recognition skills.

My Morse Code App was designed in Android Studio.
